# Virtual-Assisstant-Vision-
  The aim of our project is to develop a performance wise efficient virtual assisstant suing python
based on the concept of speech recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
A virtual assisstant, also called AI assistant or digital assisstant, is an applicatoin program that understands
natural language, voice commands and complete tasks for the user.

To build the personal assisstant we have used the following packages:
1) speech_recognition
2) pyttsx3
3) datetime
4) webbrowser
5) requests
6) os

	Our virtual assisstant (vision) can do simple jobs that include greeting the user, printing current weather, 
printing current date and time, can search anything from google, youtube, play music from gaana.com, play a movie or 
any video using the default video player app, check the internet speed, can show any location from google maps, show 
the latest news and so on.


Steps to use the code:

1)In the getQuery() functoin (line 60) get your api key from https://openweathermap.org/api by just signing in.
2)In the getQuery() function (line 103) use the path where you have .mp4 files.
3)In the getQuery() function (line 121) use the your desktop path so that u can access the shortcut for all the apps.
4)To invoke vision run the code and just say "hello vision".
